How the game works:
-You can click a tile with a resource to collect resources
-These resources stay on the tile they were collected on (each tile has a count of all resources)
-Resources can be moved through factories to process them.

-The loonkas have a preferred job (and skills? movespeed, combat, etc), but otherwise can be assigned any job (harvesting, factory-worker, traveller/conductor, trader, warrior, researcher)

-harvesting loonkas will harvest from a given tile (orchards, mines, bush fields, spice fields) - a tile can have any # of harvesters, more harvesters = more harvesting
-warrior loonkas will steal from the beeple, pirates and bandits
-traveller loonkas will move goods by foot or by train. foot takes longer and can't hold as much.
-factory-worker loonkas will run factories
-trader loonkas will trade and improve sale rate (more coins per goods)
-Researcher loonkas will use the research budget to invest in discovering new recipes
-Clowns speed up loonkas within a large block radius


-You can hire new loonkas at villages for a constant gold-fee per loonka
